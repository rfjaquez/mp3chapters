mp3chapters
===========

 Command line utility for adding chapter marks to mp3 files.

 Many podcast and audiobook apps on Android and iOS support chapter markers in mp3 files

 This uses the `eyeD3 <https://github.com/nicfit/eyeD3>`_ lib to read and write the chapters details

requirements
------------
 Python 3

installation
++++++++++++

 ``pip3 install mp3chapters``

usage

 The chapter markers format should be in either::
 
 - Timecode: hours:minutes:seconds.milliseconds + space + chapter title
 - Milliseconds: milliseconds (whole) + space + chapter title
 - Audacity: seconds (floating point) + tab + seconds (no used) + tab + chapter title

Assuming you have a file named ``episode_42.mp3``, ``mp3chaps`` looks for a chapter marks file called ``episode_42.chapters.txt`` in the same directory::
 
 00:00:00.000 Introduction 
 00:02:00.000 Chapter Title 
 00:42:24.123 Chapter Title 
 
 00000000 Introduction
